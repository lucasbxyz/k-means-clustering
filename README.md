This project applies the K-Means Clustering algorithm to group U.S. universities into two clusters: private and public institutions. Although we have the true labels indicating whether each university is private or public, we intentionally ignore them during the clustering process, as K-Means is an unsupervised learning algorithm.
In typical real-world scenarios, the true cluster labels are unknown, so the primary focus is on discovering underlying patterns in the data without supervision. However, in this case, we use the actual labels at the end of the project to evaluate the clustering performance. This evaluation is purely theoretical and includes tools like the confusion matrix and classification report, which wouldn't normally be available in unsupervised learning tasks.
The dataset contains 770 observations and 18 variables, including features such as the number of applications received, acceptance rate, enrollment numbers, academic performance indicators, tuition and room costs, student-to-faculty ratio, faculty qualifications, and graduation rates.
The goal of the project is to see how well K-Means can cluster these universities based solely on numerical features, without knowing whether they are public or private. It demonstrates the capabilities and limitations of unsupervised clustering techniques on structured educational data. This project is an assignment from the Udemy course: [Python f√ºr Data Science, Machine Learning & Visualization](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-data-science-machine-learning).
